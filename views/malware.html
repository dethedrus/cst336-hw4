                <h3><u><strong>Antiviral Protection is no Longer Enough</strong></u></h3>
                <p>Virii that exist solely to damage systems seem to be entirely anachronistic in the modern era. <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/tn-archive/dd632948(v=technet.10)?redirectedfrom=MSDN"><b>Malware</b></a>, while technically emcompassing all computer software that does intentional damage to a computer system, has come to define the systems that exist to steal data or extort money from people. The rise of ransomware in the 2010s has seen a seismic shift in how virii affect users. Damaging the system is only a tool, not the goal... forcing someone to give a nefarious actor money (frequently cryptocurrency) to restore their system after the entirety (or important parts) has been forcibly encrypted.</p>
                <p>Other threats that are far more nefarious, and harder to detect simply by their execution.</p>

                    <dd>Software that comes from compromised or purposely infected websites uses local CPU cycles to mine cryptocurrency in the background without user knowledge.</dd>

                    <dd>Emails seek to steal login credentials for bank and provider websites. While many are comically poorly written, the goal is similar to the Nigerian Prince (aka Spanish Prisoner) scam. The goal is NOT to confuse a discerning reader, but to scoop up the entirely credulous who won't question the contents.</dd>
